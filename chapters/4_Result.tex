\section{Role and Responsibilities Analysis}
As a Full Stack Android Developer Intern, the role involved a blend of frontend and backend development responsibilities. The primary focus was on mobile application feature development (70\%), with backend API development and integration accounting for 20\% of the time, and the remaining 10\% dedicated to cross-functional collaboration, including daily standups, sprint planning, and design discussions. This structure provided a holistic view of the development process and fostered a deep understanding of the entire application stack.
